FIX edit daily model, not sure why save_yaml is not working
******Add delete to Estimate, and delete all children
put % values as whole number
change % to whole number % in daily view
move number of instances above % utilization
Need to add bar chart partial
Add show hide javaascript for month parameters
Add display for current instance configurations
Make screen width more usable
figure out export, may do pdf...
add chart for number of instances
add chart for %usage per month
add chart for each type added, may want toggle to select if this is generated since we may have many instance configs
change config.name to be web, not ItemName which is <estimate name>-<name>
